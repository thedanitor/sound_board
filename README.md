# Sound Board

https://thedanitor.github.io/sound_board/

This project is from the Day 9 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

First time using the <audio> tag and I will look for more opportunities to incorporate sounds into my sites.

### Things Learned

* audio element had built-in .play(), .pause(), currentTime() functions
* I recently discovered that removing outline on focus can make sites less accessible. In this case I reduced the opacity and increased the size to make up for it. I will continue to look into better techniques.
